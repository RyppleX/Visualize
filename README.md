# Visualize
Visualize wetlands data via GEE

## Assets
All the assets used in this script are set to public read, these assetswere imported into GEE for visualization. I believe GEE does some internal tiling to make it efficient.

For eg. Asset WA_WIP_10m_Dan_R1 is found at (https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/ee-wetseal/assets/WA_WIP_10m_Dan_R1)

## Running the project
GEE needs a project, possibly a Cloud project, if you try to open this project on your Google account (its required), it'll ask you to create a new project. Say yes, it also has some stpulation on how this App is used, Educational or Commercial.
